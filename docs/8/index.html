<p>You are required to submit the following text file
<a href="../../for_students/08-workbook.txt" class="for_students">08-workbook.txt</a> that contains a checklist and evaluation of your own work to the WB8 Canvas Assignment (<em>please keep a copy of the file in your Workbook repo too</em>). You can directly modify the following text file by putting an &ldquo;x&rdquo; or &ldquo;X&rdquo; inside the square brackets, and add notes to explain your work after the colon on each line.</p>
<iframe
    title="08-workbook"
    src="../../for_students/08-workbook.txt"
    class="includebox"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the following checklist
<a href="../../for_students/08-workbook.html" class="for_students">08-workbook.html</a> to generate the content of the text file: please make sure you have the correct text file
<a href="../../for_students/08-workbook.txt" class="for_students">08-workbook.txt</a> in this workbook and submit it to Canvas.</p>
<iframe
    title="08-workbook"
    src="../../for_students/08-workbook.html"
    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p>Again, if you do not fill in checklist properly, you may lose points for items you completed, and if you over-claim many items you haven&rsquo;t completed, you may also lose points for that item plus an additional 10 to 20 percent for &ldquo;correct WB8 Canvas Assignment submission&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="canvas-wb8g-workbook-gallery-assignment-submission">Canvas WB8G (Workbook Gallery Assignment) Submission</h2>
<p>Take a screenshot or a recording of the following boxes. You can use the screenshot/record buttons we provided (or right-click on Canvas and &ldquo;Save image as &hellip;&rdquo;), or you can use your own screenshot/screen-recording software (please do not use your camera or phone to take a picture or record a video). If you submit it before the due date and your work satisfies most of the basic requirements, you will get 10 points, and if your work goes above and beyond the basic requirements (either it is obvious from your screenshot or recording or you have to explain in
<a href="../../for_students/08-gallery.txt" class="for_students">08-gallery.txt</a> ), you will get 20 points. The WB8G Canvas Assignment will be closed at the due date, so you will not be able to earn the 20 points for WB8G Assignment submission.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The End!</h2>
<p>This really is the end of the workbook. Don&rsquo;t forget to commit everything and push it back to GitHub. And, when you&rsquo;re done, don&rsquo;t forget to do the WB8 Canvas Assignment that tells us that your assignment is ready to be graded, and submit the WB8G Canvas Assignment if you completed the workbook on time.</p>
