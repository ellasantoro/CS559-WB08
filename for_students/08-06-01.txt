Please describe the buildings you created in this file 08-06-01.txt
Explain how you made the buildings. 

I created three buildings: a larger house with roof outlooks, a smaller house with
a pyramid roof, and a castle with towers and cone roofs. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building 1: Small white house with blue pyramid roof
- house base was built using two triangles per square, and each square serving as a face
  of the cube. the roof was made using 4 triangles as sides and one square (two triangles) as
  the bottom which creates the closed roof shape. the roof is slightly larger than the cube so that
  it creates some overhang & dimension for aesthetic purposes. 

- texture: there is a door mapped on using the texture loader and uvs. uvs were calculated by hand using
  the method learned in class, but because the door image had no padding around the actual door part, I had to
  use negative numbers to "shrink" the image so that it would fit nicely onto the building.

Building 2: Castle with towers
- this building is the only building that uses some three geometries like cylinder and cone,
  but it does still use quite a bit of buffer geometry as well. each tower is made of a cylinder,
  and each roof is made of a cone. The walls are made out of 6 triangles each - there is an outer face and an
  inner face for each of the front, back, left side, and right side walls, as well as a top for all of those as well.

- texture: this castle uses a brick texture (it may be harder to see with the darker color I chose, but if you zoom in just a tad
  it should be very easy to see, and is scaled right using uvs). The texture mapping does not use UVS on the cone and cylinder since
  they are not buffer geometries. the texture mapping DOES use uvs on every triangle within the walls of the castle.

Building 3: Larger house with brown roof and roof outlooks
- this house is the most different in terms of meshes made compared to the other buildings. it uses the same simple
  base (just that its rectangular) with two triangles per face, but for the roof we have two triangles on the front and back,
  and then two slanted rectangles connecting them (these are each made of two slanted triangles). Then, there are little parts 
  of the roof that come outwards (I looked this up and it says its called a dormer). The dormer was originally going to be made of three triangles,
  one in the front, and one on each side that is parallel to the original roof slant. This did work, but the dormer didnt come out as far as I wanted,
  and to be able to have it farther out, I would have to turn the triangle sides into rectangles so that the parts would still connect. As I was fixing it,
  I realized I was able to just make one long roof portion that peeks out on each side. so that is what I did. I have a similar shape to the original roof of this
  building, but going in a different direction, and smaller. 

- texture: I used a window texture for these houses, which was done using uvs and texture loader. It can be found on the sides of this
  house.
