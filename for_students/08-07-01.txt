Please describe the vehicles you created and how you made them in this file 08-07-01.txt
I created a red care using Buffer Geometry - it had lots of ridges and slanted squares (made up of triangles),
and it uses cylinder geometry for the wheels. The texture is on the front of the car as the windshield wiper. Because the color
of the car is a bit dark, I think you'll have to zoom in just a tad to see the windshield wiper.
